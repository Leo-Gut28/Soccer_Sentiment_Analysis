glad finally found Fedes best position football pitch general
see Barca see headless chickens running around lot skill team Xavi doesn‚Äôt know extract like need play players strengths weaknesses example Xavi expected old dog like Lewandowski take bit different role play making Like get old striker play around took gamble Lewy never tikitaka player Balde struggling deliver ball box yet Ferran gets taken instead Roque gets minutes faster Lewy coming back 41 actual fuck high line Vinny faster everyone Barca defense‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and goal 1 2‚Ä¶no change plans don‚Äôt know still employed honestly
Madrid fucking around two thirds match Vini Jude spamming trick moves sake Dominant performance
Don‚Äôt think scoreline one justice
ref blew whistle mercy fuck man
huge respect Xavi staying Real Madrids celebration applauding coaches mightve binned medal walked straight dressing room high line vs Rodrygo Vinicius failed quick 20 complicated game 21 Real Madrid threatening every time went Comfortable without ball Bar√ßa uncomfortable without little threat Joao Felix little imagination got gameplan shut pressure Frenkie impossible get ball dont bite situation let Bar√ßa play ball around mostly sidelines Vini Rodrygo Bellingham ball vs Bar√ßa get shut vs Atleti reason game Thursday complicated theres one team eager shut spirits Atleti calls bench Vini Brahim typical Today man showed dont cant wait CL knockouts come around see best
Madrid without proper striker
wonder dudes Miami thinking old team watched game
Carvajal insane past months Back one best RBs world
Favourite moment far Kroos‚Äô catwalk
Barcelona lost Copa del Rey second leg 40 last year Real nearly played exact defence line expected things happen differently Despite Araujo‚Äôs nightmare performance like last year‚Äôs mentioned gameXavi use right back stop Vini Vini destroys also like last year‚Äôs game That‚Äôs biggest indicator Xavi tactics never change plan matter bad
Time Xavi youd think Players look like downed tools
point Laporta also take blame imo shouldnt view short term success vital long term squad planning Hiring q coach hadnt coached top 5 league team building squad even risking financial sustainability hiring former player agent sporting director
Real Madrid physical team compared Barcelona
Cant wait hear excuse Xavi use time
Fede Valverde Horse never seems tire Sometimes performances overlooked hes menace
Barcelona team honestly really bad
expecting Barcelona good season oh man brothers ass
Felix one tried looks everybody else didnt wanna run
Looks like Barca players don‚Äôt even care lol
really pass side side lose ball concede terrible awful excuse football
Madrids injuryriddled team still mile ahead starting XI mention tactics Araujo maybeee Lewa Pedri would get near Madrid team
forward backline Xavi Complete nonsense extremely predictable would happen facing Vini Rodrigo slow backline playing middle field Xavi still kept half time lucky Real Madrid didnt seem want win could ended 61 easily
Defensively worst Barcelona ever seen absolute disastrous performance real Madrid really pushed third goal could Barcelona biggest defeat ever Incredible team downgraded much compared last season
put Roberto didnt touch ball 5 times maybe dont wanna attack play suicidal highline FUCK whole whos playing RB lets change every game fuckin bullshit choose one stick Kounde needs benched need CDM cant keep going like Congrats Real Madrid well fuckin deserved
positive today Madrid took foot gas final 25 minutes save energy derbi Copa coming really couldve scored 6 made utter humiliation gulf class massive comprehensively outplayed
Xavi Zidane
Tchouameninga guy Absolute masterclass Casemiroesque performance

Barca played shit somehow players last season regressed massively it‚Äôs baffling
Real scary need put screws early prevent getting first gear individual talent every position always mess
57 possession Barca surely considered win
Thing real side almost impossible team control centre park players like valverde Bellingham tchouameni camavinga kroos modric team everything physicality experience skill stamina goals mentality assists etcetc
know might seem like useless comment god miss teams unbelievable players 20052018 el classico I‚Äôve seen lifetime peak football however depressing
Usually even much better Barca doesn‚Äôt really show head heads today several levels 2 teams
Looking bad comments happened Xavi Didnt win league last season changed 6 months Genuine question since dont follow laliga much
super cup played Saudi Spain
Remember Carvajal said preseason friendly Madrid would destroy Bar√ßa season everyone shat hated speaking truth Enjoyhttpswwwredditcomrsoccercomments15dkmn3danicarvajalinofficialcompetitionswewill
dont think postMessi depression really settled Bar√ßa yet
disaster performance players identity hilariously bad single positive game going continue way Xavi helm Wow Congrats Madrid win Vini electric guess gotta really hit rock bottom bounce back Pain
Lunin saved Madrid 10x better Kepa
Xavi clueless old suicide tactics season Sack end season
happy victory Madrid lots improve defence want win always want win
day understand Lewandowski left Bayern join severely struggling Barca
Props Real coach knows he‚Äôs
Anyone else think Laporta looks like John Gotti
2 years 4 transfer windows later team still left without identity Xavis flaws tactical approach ingame adaptation opposition starting show near end 2122 season yet winning La Liga last season due overperforming defence underperforming rivals overshadowed lot Rarely exploit weaknesses opposition quite often plays directly strengths best players Setting today Roberto inverted LW gave us 0 dribbling threat wings surprise attacking looked better F√©lix Lamine Ferm√≠n pitch lack directness dynamism without awful Pointing things consistent basis last year would get criticised fans clubs lacked perspective requirements coach elite club Bar√ßa also culers ignorant towards glaring flaws Xavi turned initial situation around Incompetent sporting medical teams means gap Busi left massive multiple injured players every time Getting rid Xavi monkeys paw situation given likely board appoint incompetent Rafa Marqu√©z replacement point lucky regressed Napoli CL still beat us heck incredibly lucky fortunate CL group yet still made hard work Things looking good Almost every team face confident getting us reiterate previous point top coach would make team top contenders
Lewandowski talking Real Madrids coaching staff must telling bad Xavis tactics
Honestly Madrid good Bar√ßa look absolutely clueless going nowhere meet Rodrygo Vini Jude Fede good
Luckily Barcelona playing Saudi Arabia pretend friendly match shame play official match another country even Saudi Arabia
Cooked mostly first gear Second half especially abysmal Barca Questions asked much regressing Xavi squad getting better atleast paper
Xavi enough credit bank survive importantly Barcelona enough money bank sack
Brutal

Objectively speaking Barcelona absolutely atrocious defending lacked dynamics creativity Lack kind idea create chances little attempt pass Lewandowski basically oftentimes play outside pen area aid team creation chances like Felix nice touch try ultimately shot straight keeper like pretty much attempts apart nice Lewys goal Barcelona plays like bunch egoistic individualistic players trying super stars beyond team mate slow concept breach Reals defence Real many levels better Barcelona today outplayed big time played dynamically ideas creativity played last touch
Things change TerStegen comes back rightright
Joao Felix entire career vs Real Madrid 0 goals 0 assist 0 wins Simeone good binning crybaby
Fewer things bring joy football Barcelona thrashing

Barcelona
long time Madrid fan thing dislike Barcelona always style play It‚Äôs like playing keep away always finding safe pass sideways backwards often vertical style play it‚Äôs lackluster course frustrating can‚Äôt get ball aren‚Äôt even trying go forward either yes maybe Madrid fan don‚Äôt dislike Barcelona cause rival it‚Äôs like play safe play direct football
heard much match supposed turn Barca‚Äôs season around hope Barca extend Xavi‚Äôs contract next 5 years
Vini masterclass
xavi truly something Plays Roberto rw plays high line entire game subs Pedri keeps lewandowski entire game also single attempt outside box almost entire game youre least 2 goals spending entire 90 min trying break middle Dude amateur imho know front free dogshit man hes touch high level football Struggling score goal 90 minutes instructing players shoot outside box absurd hes got nowhere go useless possession Players reach box start spinning circles looking another pass instead shooting goal desperate shot outside box

Hopefully Araujo exposed matchBarca PR hyped muchFoul merchant
Barcelona midfield ain‚Äôt got one grown man
Supercopa finals never lot atmosphere classico final circumstances unheardof sportswashing selling playing Saudi Arabia disgraceful people claiming football culture farce promotes anything greed part problem
Man Utd ü§ù Barca Clown managers killing club

Let‚Äôs honest Barcelona Xavi didn‚Äôt bad game got bad luck whatever
Bro watched game 20 shades
Come mate can‚Äôt seriously criticising Xavi
""
Sarcasm without think
Well hope
‚Äúor whatever‚Äù makes lean direction
comment whatever
xavi unemployed
genuinely reason employment earned another chance winning league opinion importantly broke planning next season involve selling whoever bar pedri using money buy good NONBARCA manager players positions actually need CDM RB LW
xavi decided play high line vini rodrygo first question
old dog like Lewandowski üíÄ
perfectly summarized going since first season Although admit defense perfect LaLiga last year
Roque came Brazil young injured Expecting make difference immediately bit much eased
Barca looked like gave Xavi second half abysmal
Barcelona awful Madrid didnt even anything creative broke every time went forward got repeatedly gifted opportunities Barcelona top one 10 minute stretch around 2030 Madrid looked bored really terribly contested final
Madrid sleep walking second half Bellingham taking piss showboating point lol
Yeah embarrassing Felt like 61 game
It‚Äôs bad enough agree XD
Endrick gonna tear shit apart
Yes
Atleti trouble season still two games
3rd keeper Embarassing performance Bar√ßa Disasterclass Xavi
God mbappe haaland team would war crime
without starting keeper defenders
idk door open Haaland CL City wouldnt crazy went accepted Well Raiola still agent wouldnt doubt would happen
Probably switched NFL halftime
Gluten free carva best rb world
He‚Äôs changed lot last season since becoming captain
know I‚Äôm biased it‚Äôs hard believe there‚Äôs better RB season He‚Äôs incredible defensively offensively complete fullback
involved many goals indirectly setup suits perfectly
Lmao he‚Äôs even close Trent Walker Trippiers level Never understood hype Jack Grealish people cooked good He‚Äôs pretty much Spanish Glen Johnson
Whats crazy didnt adjust tactics half got ass handed 45 mins like yeah path victory
time Pique said planing coach
sure fire CL knockout stages unless really good alternative market right Lopetegui Setien ü§™
looked like best players gave towards end second half Zero effort aside maybe Felix Fermin
extended contract months ago doesnt make sense
I‚Äôve honestly got idea what‚Äôs happening Xavi could someone fill seems he‚Äôs done full 180 promising young manager set bring Barca back Spanish ETH
hard see forrest behind trees melancholic memory Pep also look former player rivals zidane paper hiring Xavi giving players asked even means mortgaging future kinda made sense 1st 18 months year absolutely clear Xavi Barca needs right rebuild
Real Madrid superior team everything compared Barcelona
legit cant remember match wasnt case opponents
heard grass high low sure
entertaining wanted manita bad
Probably something scoreline telling story possession
Somewhere dominated robbed
Something grass
Xavi like Uhoh deserved win played bootifull football uh real Madrid got luckyandoh grass long pitch wasnt big enough match Saudi Arabia
Literally look forward
wind
Maybe completely misjudge player material surely much competetive squad tell G√ºndo FdJ Pedri midfield years CL winnwr Id believe
Xavi miniature hairy Ten Hag absolute clown
least Xavi league Ten hag done absolutely nothing
Ten Hag League Cup also eliminated yous EL either things super impressive comment objectively incorrect
üçø
Would also want see hes going blame players wish could know G√ºndogan thinking seeing frustrated last time
love
bad didnt score banger match
It‚Äôs Xavi playing favorites basically ten hag 20
got lucky league last seasonthis true level
dont win leagues lucky Thats last trophy would get lucky
overperformed defensively also title rivals included underperformed well
u dont really get luck across 38 games go king
Ter Stegen title imo
BACK MaTS get credit definitely
10 kings
act like takes away merit title win lol major cope
Araujo red card felt like aside maybe Fermin everyone else gave last 10 mins basically Real passing ball around Barcas half taking shots felt like one pressing
Fermin gave one looked like gave fuck second half
mate players xavi üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tbf team got used playing without Tibo Eder Alaba less starting line get point Vini came back long injury well
Araujo right back Carvajal incredible form rn lb yeah would def take lewa tho
Idk Frenkie didnt good game today think overall better midfielder Tchouameni even Valverde Keepers pretty equal also
Theyre different type midfielders makes sense compare need three kinds midfielders team said De Jong still wouldnt make Madrids midfield simply due presence Kroos Modric Bellingham
Without even going additional rotation Valverde Tchouameni Camavinga
think wild rate 2024 Modric 2024 De Jong
Modric Modric Whenever played still oozes quality even cant play every week least thats saw CL time went sub 12 loss also still pretty fucking awesome match Atletico yeah especially big games Ill pick Modric time since hes sure thing mention De Jong pretty mid match pretty much entire midfield really
""
dont think Frenkie better Tchouameni Valverde based opinion game season LOL
Lmao Valverde contention best midfielder world based performance season people would know actually watched Reals games maybe bases view one match
Frenkie allright
missed half games due injury lol
Yeah Kdb missed almost season came back best player 2 substitutions played games guess Fdj played 16 games small sample size
course also Someone consistently good 20 games held higher regard someone good 10 games
Tchouameni literally 3 apps Frenkie player injured doesnt mean isnt better player unless think KDB isnt good Kovacic Kovacic played
blind Im clearly talking Fede comparable case huge skillgap Kova isnt world class player Fede
Also 2 3 goals whole game single shot outside box except goal hilarious like threatens shoot something
Honestly happened defence largely players guess change system dont pay close enough attention know ins outs Xavi defence best Spain hell one best world last season see crumble far half season bizarre
opinion last season Xavi managed motivate squad years failure last season Barcelona overperformed specially defensively season enough
think madrid didnt important games coming would 61
doubt real Madrid always like Barcelona chance inflict truly humiliating instead keep pushing decide reduce intensity
get Xavi fired
positive today Madrid took foot gas final 25 minutes final 25 minutes Dude took foot gas soon 20 lol Thats reason team 65 possession scored goal
ref helped us well blowing whistle without extra minutes
Yeah hes better Get man lifetime contract
Better Zidane Jota Jordi
Benching City last year crime
Would love see detailed tactical analysis roles Tchouameni Valverde season looks like Tchou acts deep lying playmaker security case press gets beaten Valverde defensive midfield dirty work helps attackers connect short passes transition
Guy haters can‚Äôt believe
fair theres way club gave Xavi free rein make signings really need fucked Barcas financials rn got new signing bargain bin deals dont money really running real world class signings upon time mightve discussion signing Mbappe Haaland similar star player example nowadays even picture Theres reason signings essentially kicked clubs Dont get wrong think signing good really think Xavi would picked striker end career really blank check
right tactical ideas Sticking back favorites like happened Bayern away united away today man wanted busquets alba stay planning convincing board keep roberto lmao
statement doesnt require first part flow second
great talent defense season make team look super scary seen team concede goals like lower division teams
Rather say shit say Real Madrid good
True Good point reality Barcelona stellar team superb defense simply overcome Real Madrid
already knoww thats excuse gonna
true Barca dna
fair Madrid phenomenal Bar√ßa low point since crisis hand Madrid 2005 2009 ass started turn world menace became CR Benzema Alonso arrived summer 2009
Agreed it‚Äôs game 10 years ago Gaza Strip would cease fire game
want win trophies Barca wants win Real
thing last year‚Äôs CdR classico
form la Liga carried gross defensive overperformance Ter Stegen god mode failed opposing strikers would manage miss open goal also rival us Atleti didnt even bother show la Liga
personnel downgraded every position Last season Barca already started looking bad injuries Pedri Dembele able grind wins defence included Busquets performing Ter Stegen time they‚Äôve lost Dembele Gavi Busquets Ter Stegen although replacements still decent don‚Äôt play way Xavi‚Äôs attacking tactics usually involved winger beating man wide that‚Äôs Dembele integral Without they‚Äôve kind reliant Cancelo wasn‚Äôt fit today without Busquets Ter Stegen Kounde wanting play RB defence also seems complete disarray situation injuries Xavi‚Äôs inexperience becoming really noticeable Barca still decent options seems like Xavi doesn‚Äôt know fit together cohesive unit also seems like might starting lost dressing room bit comments made players individual errors pitch It‚Äôs really fault think experienced coach would handle better current situation
much Xavis fault Hes partially blame yes team doesnt finish chances believe Barcelona number 1 team chances missed Last season also carried amazing defense Lewandowski garbagefor half season atleast luck
Money
Ask Pique
Oh thats gold
People said cooked cooking rn
Wanted comment lol 2 wins far
Thanks enjoyed
Idk man one depressed since left lol
Araujo also massive us
Theres way benches Courtois hes playing amazing shame bench play Maybe share games play first choice top teams
please
best GK TWO important CBs ironically best defensive season
fantastic place retire hes great contract Cant blame TBH
think always linked Madrid way going replace BdO winning Benzema sure ultimately chose Barcelona get shot BdO getting snubbed couple times
got offered huge long term contract earning year
That‚Äôs called money big fat contract multiple years Bayern offering 1year business oriented club
Didnt win everything Germany already guess titles aint everything retire live warmer country nice city talking shit Germany maybe 10 years nice change country fans tend see football perspective lot lives also millionare id also fk somewhere family wanted
Hard understand Barcelona even wanted tbh
Yeah Idk would want bum scored 50 goals 46 games prior season already stacked top goal scoring machines Depay Aubameyang Braithwaite Luuk de Jong
disrespect Luukinho üò§
needed star ig lewy
Looks like shell fish allergy üòÇ
dude essay ready lmao
long typed Lmaoo
Probably youre right Xavi Anyway IMO Bar√ßas biggest mistake famous levers used Laporta Translating proverb bread today hunger tomorrow
experience doesnt know matches like example chances coming doesnt know
told swap deal Joselu
saw fucks given lmao
best way counter play high line slow defenders
Yeah win like last year holds something real value signifies confidence progress
Well kinda tbh always good beat rival
much paper people don‚Äôt like admit Dembele made big difference showed Clasicos Busquets albeit aging one still replacement sight anytime soon Araujo Kounde Christensen apparently forgotten play professional football Balde don‚Äôt get started Balde It‚Äôs like swapped real Balde goddamn cousin
clear toying them‚Ä¶
would even bring
good game hes still beast
offered much
still looks bad
Sad see father beat son badly front whole world
Nobody knows havent seen team press well without Gavi ever even much better form tactical suicide
Xavi idiot actual tactics
look comment history subbreddit youre going see much hate xavi coach dude sucks tactics acts like smartest coach ever saw result coming miles away fact watched got humiliated girona monjuic see team actually dogshit cannot compete anything
press didn‚Äôt know
without Gavi team nobody knows press
Xavi cooking something
clip
Nostrarvajal
Laporta resign
exactly plan sacking coach mid season Jesus fucking christ
last season good derby close
Oshimhen hattrick CL may time record
whos gonna shit lmao
imagine mboopi also joins Counters absolutely devastating
criticized young player leaving La Liga play Saudi Arabia
cant buy player
increasing wages like Lewy Business masterclass
Brahim got unlucky final third scored
Thats hilarious everyone sucking Vini rn done anything special Like practically begged someone run behind score us way defense leaving fucking acre space back fast player could scored 45 us today one worst high lines Ive ever seen
Either way goal created Rodrygo still Vini finish
battle middle
think Barca play even 50
Rather bring Guiu
Roque saviour
Bold brass
second goal failed offside trap
wasnt Bar√ßa fan regularly Bar√ßa subreddit would call BS friend saying cules really embraced delulu fanbase ever since Laporta took
Think ends 2029 Doubt
TerStegen also play CB RB CDM ST‚Ä¶ time üò≠
fair beautiful chance today lunin saved
dortmund fan hate barca Youve played 2 times decades group stage lol
much happy dortmund fan tbf
ever u
Bar√ßa ‚ÄúWhy say fuck for‚Äù
Bellingham man among boys
balde fallen soo much season
Doubt even barca indepth post match analysis xD
Top content thanks mate
always love analysis man look forward every Barcelona game Keep way way things going season think finally time sack Xavi best resources think sell summer think get
honestly don‚Äôt think passing system worked Yes Madrid drop deeper even distinct lack effort team Madrid passive Barca‚Äôs tactic working Barca‚Äôs recruitment piss poor Lewa clearly wasn‚Äôt good option aging striker 4 year deal salary increases sounds like 12 solution fit it‚Äôs clearly showing team isn‚Äôt designed anyway Bayern focal point culmination attacks Barca role looks confusing can‚Äôt drop deep like Kane Benzema even force Lewa clearly doesn‚Äôt fit Barca style yet transfer done issues Barca start top ie board don‚Äôt agree every Perez decision like large segment fanbase clearly competent keeping club strong position Brazilian Gambit paid major ways Reiner failed also cheapest Endrick looked promising enough Brazil firmly believe Madrid best balanced midfield world Meanwhile Laporta punted money many failed transfers poor coach Xavi Yes deserved league last season Madrid messed around much transfer plan looks like shooting dark hoping something sticks
first goal repeated many times season offside trap would set wrongly one defender cannot remember set offside trap successfully season cannot say thats individual mistake coaching issue guessing latter Lewy static spoton case gets ball deep almost loses ball makes pass losing tempo stay harm drops deep
Mate need TLDR shit
long post
Cheers Geoff
available
early retirement Barcelona belly shows
part problem Absolutely energy past games
Gundogan great player one several signings desperately needed one solid midfielder isnt going fix fact depth basically position Im thankful got midfield getting injured daily needed someone step frontline still impotent defenders still laughably shit simply solid backups take starters form Like dipping youth team sheer desperation dont anyone else call RW fucking 16 year old true striker another youth player Like wtf honestly concerned future club financially fucked rn cant picture club able afford new players need sign able get rut literally need sign 12 players basically every position point wild
fair Bar√ßa went trophyless 2122 season Xavi excuse come halfway Supercopa La Liga 2223 Bar√ßa still 3 trophies safety nets
Extremely physical technical time hard midfield play around team itw rn
It‚Äôs called diamond reason üòÅ
played 120 mins 3 days ago tough schedule coming
Saving energy Atletico JanFeb schedule

Really start watching football Messi left Barca

Barca fans choose suffer That‚Äôs insane probably top 3 team support last 10 years
Barca fan talking shitüíÄ dont support teams like valencia shi say

willing reduce salary maximum could‚Äôve reduced Barca didn‚Äôt FFP Margin
reduced salary still letting earn money full Salaried Ronaldo ever us‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs astronomically high wage
Thats management problem money could sued Barca plenty times shitty things pulled years
would sue getting money either way Plus already tried suing didn‚Äôt trigger leave clause time wanted out‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs Barca fans showed Messi FC fans
would sue getting money either way wasnt still deferred wages till day lot fuckery went negotiations Plus already tried suing didn‚Äôt trigger leave clause time wanted Thats example suing letting slide even getting fucked
loyalty bonus hard pass
u think loyalty bonus bigger could taken suing thats want imagine good Either way Messi turned 15 billion taxfree contract Barca never sent contract even free agent
turned play free Miami Doesn‚Äôt even stock club doesn‚Äôt gateway mls club much rather prefer imagine Messi humble player would actually play free Barca‚Ä¶ money exist
Making strawman arguments confronted facts lowest type response anyone brain could make take discussion
Bro accepted reduced salary La Liga didn‚Äôt allow Barca register himStop disrespecting club legend
lol wasn‚Äôt allowed even reduced salary Barca couldn‚Äôt afford fair play Like you‚Äôre grasping high salary
yet Bar√ßa still paying salary 2025 per Laporta
Messis PR team greater Barcelonas surely spread propaganda
Didn‚Äôt agree reduced salary Laporta pull plug end
defer salary theres reason still paying 2025
Well judging different Bar√ßa sources willing slash salary lot LaLiga didnt allow unless Bar√ßa accepted CVC deal
explicitly said watches games anything Messi truly loves Barca
Lol Barca wouldn‚Äôt bigger Nottingham Forest without Messi
think started watching football yesterday stfu
actually planned starting tomorrow recommendations
Dont ride Messi

Depends UCL

Good night love üòò
He‚Äôs good looking midfielder great highlight reel without context every he‚Äôll something insane he‚Äôs genuinely middling player fancier Ceballos ask
Pedri Gavi better
honestly never understood appeal know Dutch players highly appreciated Barca Cruyff legacy De Jong Barca DNA whatever honestly Pedri IMHO meh especially terms consistency thing Barca theyre nostalgic golden era overhype small players Xavi Iniesta vibes assume similar players recreate era bad transfer windows dont know value players paid 70M Raphina 50M Torres like LOL last successful signing literally Suarez 9 years ago Right really believe squad compete Xavis fault yeah Xavi amateur best man squad way average Pedri played like 50ish games last 2 seasons COMBINED consider best player best player cant play 30 season cant finish classico bruh moment really need reassess squad understand really dont quality players like think Xavi isnt one coaches players evolve needs baseline quality work far hes average squad
Vinicius called toughest opponent also affected Barca PR one using fact bad period push agenda Barca
Youre hating hate think Aruajo isnt good
Youve waiting post 4 years congratulations

Shit take
Different player roles
deleted
must new internet
want go route youll need add Mats Araujo Balde Frenkie Gavi Yamal unsellable
Whenever camera panned Xavi second half looked like given Xavi
kinda insane felt like Barca never threat watching game Every attack would think werent going score every Madrid attack felt like would Embarrassing Barca defense also shit go one best defensive seasons LaLiga history
felt like 101 game
Lunin Kepa
Kepa available Hes lost Lunin
Eh Barca injuries Real including keeper Still disasterclass though
went Kane instead twerking mbappe last windows
Hoping turtle robot also nice

Yes Nacho sub Carvajal normally captain would start Nacho starting injuries players He‚Äôs 4th choice CB Anyways Carvajal doesn‚Äôt dive much doesn‚Äôt complain much much better last season
Frimpong Though idk he¬¥s really classified RB
one think compare Walker going old still big threat ever attacking
thought wanted President club
simply better coach available terrible
Promote assistants Wait family lol
Barca afford
Flick Conte Low better managers
Im sure could convince Brendan Rodgers come Scotland
Flick
rode luck last year year it‚Äôs run That‚Äôs basically isn‚Äôt tactically good
rebuilding patch patch deeper decision need make
Except bottling may kill watching match hope
humidity affected pitch making ball roll slower caused issues players
grass perfect threw players trained adverse situations fair
Saudi Arabia Grass dry
naaaaah Let keep Xavi little longer dont want fire yet
Ten Hag hair
Ferm√≠n channeled inner Gavi much else apart
mostly centre back
thats positive
would made fucking difference
Well written
Agree Tchou Fedes roles seem like modern version XabiKhedira double pivot 1112 said Tchou would deep lying playmaker still shield sorts Fede would Khedira role mopping defensively still instigating attacks game calls dynamic actually one favorite parts 41212442 diamond year
genuinely dont understand good young well insane potential DM
Give Grammar Dor
Ahh thanks
Mourinho turned mentality around used play scared Barca especially away good 6 years
barely created chances today lot pointless passing building absolutely nothing
chances
barca didnt even create good chances thanks lewy scored goal that‚Äôs
Dominant win Barca woeful Carvajal still 100 cooked even according Madrid fanssaying anything contrary like us turning Sergi Roberto apologists win
Carvajal fucking amazing season
madrid fans know idk guy talking
There‚Äôs Madrid fan who‚Äôs happy Carvajal atm
Either dont watch Football B another clueless Barca fan Carvajal best RB world Period Dont mention Trent defensive liability
Real Madrid wanted way Benzema season Bayern Management convinced stay however
Living beach city nice weather amazing nightlife‚Ä¶ everything makes sense
win league last year
Thats exactly true Sure Barca offered longer contract Bayern paid money main motivation Bigger reason Lewys departure ambition already everything could Bayern broke individual scoring records except alltime BuLi goalscorer hed 999 achieve anyway stayed league seasons Also probably burnt mentally needed change scenery ultimately mistake old polish saying goes pole wise loss meaning hindsight 2020
lol serious allow meme replies smth idiot one thing proudly show us cant handle others braindead whole level Embarassing

levers big issue shortterm goals mind yet preparation overpaying
ego naivety anything Hes enough time coach Bar√ßa understand expectations club especially since damn legend player Xavi 2022 ‚ÄúWe obligation win play well time Imagine it‚Äôs like Bar√ßa won‚Äôt accept scraping last minute winner 90th winning 10 we‚Äôd deciphering performance week despite winning That‚Äôs Bar√ßa know especially someone like familiar ‚Äòhouse‚Äô entire life want excellent everything That‚Äôs we‚Äôre difficult clubs world there‚Äôs comparison‚Äù Xavi today January 10th 2024 ‚ÄúThe 10 victories Well circumstances suppose believe we‚Äôve matches we‚Äôve deserved win much larger margin there‚Äôs also matches we‚Äôve should‚Äôve lost frankly said Real Sociedad didn‚Äôt deserve win match there‚Äôs matches deserve win lot Hey it‚Äôs football part would sign 10 wins tomorrow final potentially lift trophy end I‚Äôm worried statistic I‚Äôm worried things‚Äù recently shows isnt cut job
Yeah thought huge surprise considering everyone knows struggle teams sit back play behind ball
never press ball
Araujo kounde especially balde quite fast slow defender defence christensen
Yea keep Vini rodrygo
bruh id take title couple dry years
Totally it‚Äôs like lesser trophy season time it‚Äôs glorified friendly However beating FCB rolling it‚Äôs good plus
looks like Balde told can‚Äôt dribble forward space bizarre would take 1 2 touches look afraid pass back sideways tons time
demeble acted outlet midfielders think thats whats missing
Busquets always going difficult replace nearly impossible Think Zubimendi would‚Äôve decent financial situation better can‚Äôt believe actually got Golden Boy shouts Jude like Balde great potential lots improve Jude another planet compared youngsters
Zidane

Everyone hates sanctimonious cheaters it‚Äôs universal least Bayern won‚Äôt lecture they‚Äôre god‚Äôs gift football blatantly ignore rules
Youre right thats take joy get
Except watching Barca‚Äôs decline
Maybe
Thanks man try
think best resources sack immediate coach think would join big enough improvement warrant big move believe changes keeps making though unlucky constant major injury every time team looks like gaining momentum
think passing wasnt fluid would expect GundoFdJPedriRoberto midfield started Pedri waaay high isolated made adjustments though came bit closer halfway line Gundo filled space Pedri left behind attack looked fluid gave Pedri Gundo time space use creativity fullest think lack effort worrying though apparent season rest regarding Lewandowski Laporta agree lot think Xavi inexperienced coach also think showing promising signs last season lot proactive changes system bringing influence team dont think bad coach though dont think shown world class coaching either flashes brilliance see potential
hansi flick good shout
much fideu√°
hilarious focus Xavi Barcas biggest problem awful recruitment Theyve brought players near end careers frankly good enough
give shit one around either
Ive seen belly
Fuck bro publish book you‚Äôre
supercup finishing 2nd played like years doesnt even get trophy team isnt going win anything get eliminated champions league going bare minimum league cup

tuesday
Mi papa es de Honduras
Thats reasonable opportunities like dont come often could absolutely humiliated hated rival God knows owe Anyway Im saying Carlo kept Vini Rodrygo rather could subbed attacking players instead going midfielders
Nah man cares bigger scoreline super cup tight schedule ahead
Super Cup team absolutely loathe always prefer big scoreline possible course Carlos decision absolutely understandable always let like wish hunker one days give spanking lifetime
Man atleti match four days need win aswell
course decision completely understandable always let like wish forget everything else annihilate
lost 31 though ofc
know still doesnt change fact would crushed experience
know wanted say
deleted
Lmao Even Walter fucking Mazzari gonna field day us
FDJ eye test merchants wet dream Hell pull 1 amazing pass entire match pretty much nothing else people think ran show
think means physicality midfield runners bullied ball today sorely missing Gavi brought physicality midfield
Also three 18 academy players FDJ Sergio roberto always available pedri
man
clown beat Barca two legs dont know says La Liga
Thats go argument comparison clear winner
Easy say thought fucking turtle actually coming time
Mbappe actually comes would worth tbf
Yeah dont really want Mbappe since first troll 2 years ago Haaland would optimal choice players already
True sad never seriously considered
shredder always beats tmnt 1 1 tho
Yeah tbh City doesnt seem like need Haaland much makes better sure hes cherry top really need number 9 level
homies hate gluten
Hes gonna se sticks
would get older
Yes coach deal transfer budget that‚Äôs basically negative
Conte Barca would nuclear bomb waiting happen Hes complete antithesis everything club wouldnt take long piss Laporta L√∂w plays stone age football wouldnt much better Flick obviously better Barca dont players play high intensity football Bayern dont forwards press like lives depend high line becomes suicidal seen today Barca sack Xavi need seriously inspired appointment none established top coaches currently available good choices imo
üòÇ
That‚Äôs could say rest team lol
mean sore loser late tackles get involved brawls isnt much proud Still better stand lifeless guess
Saying something like gavi rudiger team quite remark lmao
Weak argument Following rule nobody could ever say anything anyone theres always players like team Guess works pinpoint Gavis dirty tricks perfectly fine somebody else Rudiger problem able say see anymore
you‚Äôre hypocrite
hypocrites including
Agreed Theyre talking Fermin Araujos behavior good thing somehow
Come guys Rome wasn‚Äôt built day let cook
extremely hard deal physically Tchou huge DM also incredible technical skills Valverdes ability run around pitch like minute 1 full 90 hard deal legs start getting tired
owned Barca 0607 0708 3 wins 4 games 1 draw away top La Liga twice also
6 years definitely traumatic 2 coaching years Madrid also got Mordic summer 2012 Casemiro winter 2013 team matured much mentaly along 3 years Mou recovering 6 years knocked round 16 Kroos Carvajal Ancelotti arrived following summer Exodia assembled
reported credible sources close couple times yes never view replace Karim major complication Karim always coachs player throughout watch day day realise Hes great football player happens play striker rather way round Plus like √ñzil connection Cristiano always almost psychic Plus always favourite Perez controversial club pitch model professional club never compromises quality factors always deciding ones decisions ones Gonzalo Karim People like Auba especially Lewy insistent Madrid per reports never FIFA simple swap team sheet lot factor Additionally perhaps due Premier League bias many deluded thinking Karim wasnt worldclass throughout inconsistent finisher even Balon dOr season much like Vini today neutrals overrate finishing sudden transformation output 2122 season hes still extremely profligate creates lot secondly finishing inconsistent previously uniformly poor exacerbated poor decision making best way view players variety finishing consistency capable great finishes great finishers brought lot qualities table important balance attack closest post insane Morata season sub 1617 didnt materialise think satisfied turned end
forgot making TikTok dances
Barca offered much longer contract salary increases every year
also didnt like Bayern talking Haaland
Man saw Vini‚Äôs 2nd got typewriter
nickname checks
would pigs left Spain happens
Bernabeu would explode pigs
seems like load bullshit
Reported Plettenberg 100 accurate
one httpsimgurcoml1eyZ7v
would take replacement Laporta Another idiot like Barto
managed Ronaldo managed Mbappe Madrid enough talent win league don‚Äôt get far CL Mbappe might necessary take edge
Rodrygo already taken Madrid edge big moments Vini already superstar
That‚Äôs point superstars don‚Äôt need season hard times come that‚Äôs show
also think best criticism sometimes stubborn plays terms selling asking think right people conflicted whether sell Araujo Bayern looking buy 100 million see could benefit sell hate us losing star players risks may help think sell Ronald Araujo keep would bring sell
Forgot reply sell sorry personally think Araujo going bad patch right like became Umtiti sudden right Pls young talented one better performers usually Selling would mistake opinion replacement able serve club long level might still improve even future sell invest money heavily DM Thats impactful purchase make right would arguably even need replace Araujo similar quality player get back ups Inigo Christensen quality Kounde also play though prone making one brainfart game Alonso back Get another back player Araujos quality unlikely cheap even available rest team offloading Lewa Saudi club lot money would massively helpful financially pave way minutes regular appearances Roque bit risky though Lewa form actively feels like harming system times scores goals badly needed right
Flick cooking team full world class players cant anything Barca
Like one Real Madrid Xavi last season league obvious earned another year
Ya que es catalan algunos dirian que el polaco ya lo habla
‚Çπ20 IIRC Tapri hard beat
claro que si
understand bad FIFA irl lol
depend UCL though like say makes semis hes staying hand go vs Napoli struggle get UCL spots done
long Bar√ßa doesn‚Äôt get embarrassed Europe get top 4 La Liga Xavi safe
Someone bit critical thinking acc read comment ‚ùóÔ∏è
sevilla yall almost relegated lol
Bellingham pedri arent clear winners comparison One plays interior one pseudo striker times
Bellingham clear winner best player comparison Even though roles substantially different theyre midfielders Bellingham way better
easier better aren‚Äôt injured lol
dont ifs buts maybes absolutes
Doesn‚Äôt matter brilliant stuff Perez done signing Kane Endrick coming stupid Mbappe isn‚Äôt 9
screaming years wanted proper striker Benzema feed one replace
People say every year every year spend summer year
Sean Dyche
Conte Barca would nuclear bomb waiting happen Hes complete antithesis everything club wouldnt take long piss Laporta want see though
Yeah dunno dude Capello‚Äôs Real Madrid machine would put fear god team Maybe good 2012 Real 2017 Real still damn good team
contradicts Im saying Barca gave contract 2026 Bayern according leaks rumours offered extension 2024 Im saying money wasnt motivating factor Lewy Im sure point life prefered guaranteed money Barca although currently nothings guaranteed cliub especially comes money hypothetical well extend contract every summer long youre healthy keep scoring goals money Bayern even total amount similar Im saying main reason left Bayern join Barca
ridiculous every damn year lewandowskis agent stirring Real Madrid rumors bayern looked player 15 years younger Lewandowski acted like diva like first time acting like
Barto jail want someone thinks cares longterm future club
mean Madrid copa last season format years ago kept would league vs cup winner Extra 2 games money possibility runners winning supercup defeats purpose
20 decent Thanks sharing
Fingers crossed year actually lol
Perez glazin Mbappe far long Kane would perfect team thx Carlo made work without N9
spent 43m summer team needs much investment espeically since Barcas aspirations win something every year
don‚Äôt need spend much already good team need new coach though
basically nonexistent attack raphinha ok times mostly shit Lewandowski can‚Äôt finish ball save life shit buildup play don‚Äôt anyone actual leftwinger play felix isn‚Äôt left winger leave summer
